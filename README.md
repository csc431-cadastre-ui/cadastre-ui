# Team 4: Cadastre

Welcome to the CSC431 Cadastre Project Homepage for Spring 2018. We are team !bad (pronounced "Not Bad") and we've been assigned as Team 4: Cadastre UI. With Cadastre Mapping, users can look at a composite drone photo of their neighborhood, draw a polygon that delineates their property lines, and store it as a uniquely identified digital property to speed up property title issuance.


## Getting Started

In order to run our project, you must first download the git repository to your local machine. For more information on how to clone a repository, follow this [link](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

Once you have a local copy of our repository, running our project is easy! Run leafletTest.html
